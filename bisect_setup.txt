Git Bisect Hunt Challenge

There is a bug in the 'level_3_bisect_hunt' branch. The 'working_function' in 'app.py' is broken.
Your mission is to find the commit that introduced the bug. The flag is in the commit message.

Good commit (working): $GOOD_COMMIT
Bad commit (broken): $BAD_COMMIT

Use 'git bisect' to find the bad commit.

Hint: 
1. git checkout level_3_bisect_hunt
2. git bisect start
3. git bisect bad $BAD_COMMIT
4. git bisect good $GOOD_COMMIT
5. Test the function (check if it returns "Working correctly" or "This is broken!")
6. git bisect reset
