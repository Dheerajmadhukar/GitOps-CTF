# Hints for Challenge 5: Patch Analysis

The flag is in a patch file but encoded.\n- Use `git apply fix2.patch` or `patch -p1 < fix2.patch` to apply the second patch.\n- The result in original.py is base64-encoded. Decode it using `echo <value> | base64 -d`.

**Branch**: `level_5_patch_analysis`

Explore the repository to find the flag using Git commands!
